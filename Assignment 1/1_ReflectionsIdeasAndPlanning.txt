1.	Based on the reports of your fellow classmates during our last class (2021-09-08), please briefly summarize any new ideas for apps to solve people’s problems that you have come up with as a result of listening to other students.
Some ideas that I have come up with as a result of listening to other student’s problems include an app that allows for easier registration for UMass Lowell Resident Students to sign in their friends into their dorms. The current website is a hassle to use and would be a lot easier to navigate with an app. 
2.	Several people mentioned the “conflict” between the desire to have a free app, and developers’ desire (and need) to get compensated. Can you suggest any ways by which developers can reap their creativity’s and efforts’ rewards without alienating their “customer base” by inundating with ads and/or charging them.
Developers can reap their rewards by email marketing, in which they make profit off of the data that the app users give the app which can be sold as data to researchers or other advertising companies. 
3.	Please point to any app/software/website that offers in your opinion an excellent UI/UX. Briefly explain in what ways you find its UI/UX to be so good.
Amazon’s app has excellent UI/UX because of how user friendly it is and how it is good to navigate around without having to search up how to find a certain feature of the app. The app has so  many functionalities that make it convenient to use on the go. 
4.	Have last class’s discussions and/or items #1-3 gotten you closer toward a mobile app you would like to pursue as a project for this course? Please discuss briefly.
A mobile app I would like to pursue is an app for UMass Lowell students to easily register students to sign them into dorms as guests. The app would remember students that have already been signed in student’s dorms and make it easier for students to have guests over without the hassle of logging in every time and reentering the information.
